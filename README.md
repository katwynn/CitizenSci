Citizen Sci

The Pinata API allows for decentralized storage of research data while simultaneously protecting and controlling the access to the data via gateways using Submarine.

Submarine.me allows NFT-gated access to files. In our case, the user gets a NFT-badge as reward for effort to validate a data pile. Not only does the NFT badge serve as “proof-of-contribution” but can also later be connected and traced to future results such as research papers or AI-algorithms, which make use of the verified data sources and therefore increase the overall quality of the research output. Data scientists usually spend up to 80% [https://blog.ldodds.com/2020/01/31/do-data-scientists-spend-80-of-their-time-cleaning-data-turns-out-no/] of their time cleaning data, which could be used more wisely for creating useful insights for society.
